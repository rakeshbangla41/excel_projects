## Sales Data Analysis Report (Customer and Market Performance)



### Problem Statement:

AtliQ Hardware is a consumer electronics company which sells its products across the globe. The company wants to understand its sales performance across different customers and markets.   

As a Data Analyst, my task is to develop Sales Reports using MS Excel that will help the company to gain sales insights.   
  
 
### Project Description:

I have used Microsoft Excel to analyse the data and created two reports using pivot table and DAX formulas. The reports are:      

1)	Customer Performance Report - this report enables the sales team to identify best performing customers over the years and the growth/decline in revenue.  
2)	Market Performance Report -  this report gives the amount of sales generated per each country and in knowing whether the sales target is achieved or not.   

By analysing and understanding the insights from these reports,  the company can work on optimizing its sales strategy across different markets and customers, identify potential business expansion opportunities in promising countries, and maximize Return on Investment (ROI).    

### What I have learned by doing this project:   

1. Pivot table  
2. Power Query  
3. Data Analysis Expression (DAX)   
4. Conditional Formatting  
5. beautifying the report to make it visally appealing  
6. important metrics related to sales domain


I have uploaded the reports in the PDF format.
